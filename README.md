# NodeIO
NodeIO is an add-on for Blender 3D (blender.org) that allows nodes and node trees to be 
exported and re-imported with ease. This means that important, or commonly used node setups 
can be saved so that they don't have to be re-built later. Currently NodeIO supports Cycles, 
Blender Internal, Mitsuba Render, Animation Nodes, and Sverchok.
