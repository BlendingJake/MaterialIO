# NodeIO
NodeIO is an add-on for Blender 3D (blender.org) that allows nodes and node trees to be exported and re-imported with ease. The add-on generates a JSON formatted file that is easy to parse. The add-on is written in such a way that making it compatible with other different types of node trees is easy. Currently, node trees from Cycles, Blender Render, and Mitsuba are supported.
